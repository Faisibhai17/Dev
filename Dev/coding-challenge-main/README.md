I cloned the repository to my local environment, fetched the data, and then unzipped the file. After opening it in Visual Studio from my local GitHub environment, I started coding in product.liquid. I organized my code into separate blocks for each option, such as title, SKU, description, price, etc. I added AJAX code to enable adding the product to the cart, and upon testing, it showed a successful message. I also added some basic styling to enhance the design. After stopping the Node process with Ctrl+C, I added comments to the README file. Finally, I committed the changes and pushed them back to the repository.
